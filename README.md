# Maize-Yield-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate maize yield in Zimbabwe using machine learning techniques. Agriculture is a vital part of Zimbabweâ€™s economy, and maize is one of its staple crops. The main objective of this project is to leverage data-driven methods to provide more reliable yield predictions.

Maize Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive system for estimating maize crop yields in Zimbabwe using historical agricultural and climatic data. It uses supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict maize yield based on various factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil quality, and fertilizer use.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Predict maize yield using machine learning models.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (RÂ² Score, RMSE, MAE).
- Help farmers and policymakers in Zimbabwe make informed agricultural decisions.
- Promote the use of data science in precision agriculture.
